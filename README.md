# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Neural Network
This repository contains code to predict stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture capable of learning long-term dependencies and is well-suited for sequential data like time series.

# Overview
The stock price prediction model follows these main steps:

# Data Preprocessing: 
Load historical stock data from an Excel file, handle missing values, and normalize the data using Min-Max scaling.
## Model Creation:
Develop a sequential LSTM model using Keras with TensorFlow backend. The model architecture includes multiple LSTM layers followed by a dense layer for regression.
## Model Training: 
Compile and train the LSTM model on the training data. The model is optimized using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.
## Model Evaluation: 
Evaluate the model's performance on both training and test datasets using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean 
Squared Error (RMSE).
# Prediction: 
Utilize the trained model to predict the next day's opening stock price.
Instructions
# Prerequisites
Install Python (3.x recommended) and necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow with Keras.
Ensure the availability of historical stock data in an Excel file (stock_data.xlsx).
Usage
### Clone the repository to your local machine:
                                           git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
### Navigate to the project directory:
                                  cd stock-price-prediction
### Run the Python script stock_prediction.py:
                                          python stock_prediction.py
The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the LSTM model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions for the next day's opening stock price.

# Output
The script will print the evaluation metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE for both training and test datasets.
It will also display the predicted next day's opening stock price based on the trained model.
